# Ultrasound and Photoacoustic simulation codes
Repository for ultrasound simulation and photoacoustic simulation codes + additional documentation

This repository contains the MATLAB scripts and the additional documentation necessary for medical ultrasound and photoacoustic simulation. See "US_codes/US_simulation_guide.docx" for a manual/operation guide on the ultrasound simulations, and "PA_codes/PA_operation_manual.docx" for the photoacoustic simulation manual. To view a manual, navigate to it, and then either click the "view raw" button or the download button, and a copy of the manual will be downloaded.

To download the entire repository, click on the green "Code" button in the top right, and there a zip file of the entire repository can be downloaded. To download a specific script, go to the script, and click the "raw' button at the top right of the viewer. A text-only copy of the script will be opened, which can then be copied into a new Matlab file on the user's computer (make sure to use the same file names if using this method!).
