# Ultrasound and Photoacoustic simulation codes
Repository for ultrasound simulation and photoacoustic simulation codes + additional documentation

This repository contains the MATLAB scripts and the additional documentation necessary for medical ultrasound and photoacoustic simulation. See "US_codes/US_simulation_guide.docx" for a manual/operation guide on the ultrasound simulations, and "PA_codes/PA_operation_manual.docx" for the photoacoustic simulation manual.

Created and managed by the Penn State BioPhotonics and Ultrasound Imaging Lab.
